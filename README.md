Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a worldwide financial institution that is looking to bolster their existing security application by adding additional features like encryption.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I did particularly well with vunerabilty testing. I really took a liking to using dependency checks in order to find vulnerabilties in a program and then giving the company the necessary mitigation tactics in order to solve the problem. It's important to securely code because most of the time code will be used in conjunction with another application or program so ensuring that the code is secure will highly reduce the risk of personal information being stolen and then leveraged. Software security will allow a company to operate without feeling like they are constantly at risk for attack. This will also give them the peace of mind to firmly assure clients that their information will be safe and properly handled.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Surely the most helpful tool I used was the dependency check, this allowed me to find the vunerabiltites in my program and then provided me with the solution to the vulnerability so I could apply it. It also reduced the amount of time it took in order to address each vulnerability which is massive in the grand scheme of things.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
 
By updating the libraries that we are working with it allows for software patches to be made that enhanced the overall security of the program. By doing penetration testing we will be able to identify problems in the future and then use the proper mitgation techniques.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

While coding the program I constantly was debugging and searching for solutions to any errors that I came across. When the code was refactored I took the opportunity to run another dependency check to see if any new problems had arisen. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Some resources I used included GeeksforGeeks.org and Stack Overflow both of these resources had valuable background information and solutions to problems I was facing.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would like to showcase my work with vunerability testing and going through the mitigation process to provide an example of my problem solving skills.
